Constraint programming constraints cannot be used in combination with real valued variables, only with integer valued variables, element valued variables, and activities. 
The real valued objective variable is an exception. 
The mathematical program "Wynik" has both constraint programming constraints and real valued variables, for instance constraint "PobraneMniejszeNizZapotrzebowanie" with type "<" which is only available in constraint programming, and variable "OdlegloscPunktuOdStacji".
